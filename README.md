**Smart Garage**

Car Service Management System

<a name="java-team-project"></a>Project Description
Your task is to develop a web application that enables the owners of an auto repair shop to manage their day-to-day job.

It must have a list with cars (manufacturer, model) and a list of available services (oil change, filters change etc.) and their price. The system must have a list with all customers and their contact information (name, phone, email, etc.). The shop’s employees must be able to link specific car to a customer. Each specific car must have some identification details (registration plate, vehicle identification number, etc.). 

**SmartGarage** should keep a history of all services done on customers’ car/cars. The application must be able to visualize a detailed report for a given visit to the shop. It must include all the performed services for the visit, as well as the total price (in the default currency or another, chosen by the employee/customer). The software could also be able to generate a PDF report with all the performed services for a given car and the total price (in the default currency or another, chosen by the customer). 

For new customers, а profile must be generated. A profile is generated by the administrator using the system and the login information is sent to customer’s email. The generated profile information is username and password (randomly generated string). Once the login information is generated, it must be sent to the customer via email. All customers must be able to access their personal information via the web UI.

  - The visit is registered and then the customer receives an email with automatically generated login information.
- Employees must be able to see a detailed report of a visit to the shop.
  - The report must include the customer info, the vehicle info, every service that was done to the vehicle and the total price. The employee must be able to choose the currency of the generated report (Use a third-party service to convert the price. See Appendix).
- Employees should be able to send a “reset password” link to a customer via email.
- Employees could be able to generate a PDF report for a given service. The report is sent to the customer via email.
## REST API
To provide other developers with your service, you need to develop a REST API. It should leverage HTTP as a transport protocol and clear text JSON for the request and response payloads. 

A great API is nothing without great documentation. The documentation holds the information that is required to successfully consume and integrate with an API. You must use [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) to document yours. 

The REST API provides the following capabilities: 

1. Users
- CRUD Operations (must)
- Employees must be able to search a user by username, email, phone, or car’s license plate/VIN (must)
1. Vehicles
- CRUD Operations (must)
- Search a vehicle by license plate or VIN (must)
- Employee must be able to search vehicles by owner’s phone number (must)
- Filter and sort vehicles by model, brand, year of creation (must) 
1. Services
- CRUD Operations (must)
- Search by name (must)
- Search by exact price (must)
- Filter and sort by name and price range(must)

# Use Cases
## A walk-in customer
New customer walks in the shop. He has never visited before. He explains what the issue with his vehicle is and an employee creates a new personal vehicle (it includes the brand, model, year, vin, and license plate). When the vehicle is created the employee creates a new service order that includes the newly created vehicle, as well as all the service procedures that need to be performed (oil change, brake fluid change…). The customer receives, on the email that he has provided, an automatically generated invoice, containing the total sum that he must pay along with every service procedure that will be performed on his vehicle. He receives another email, that contains information about his automatically generated login information.
## Forgotten password (should)
A customer has forgotten their password. They select the “Forgot password?” option and enter their email. The system checks if there is a registered user with that email. If there is one, he receives an email with a link to a page where he can enter a new password. The link should be accessible for a limited time only (say, an hour) and if accessed one, it should not be possible to access it again.
## Report request
*Note: Applicable only if PDF report generation is implemented.*

A customer lost the copy of a report that you sent him after a visit to the shop a year ago. He logs in the application, filters the list of visits by date and vehicle and goes on to generate a PDF report. He wants it to be in USD, instead of the default currency, say BGN. He receives the report on his email with the correct price, converted to USD.
# <a name="technical-requirements"></a>Technical Requirements
## General
- Follow [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) principles when coding
- Follow [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) principles when coding
- Follow REST API design [best practices](https://blog.florimondmanca.com/restful-api-design-13-best-practices-to-make-your-users-happy) when designing the REST API (see Appendix)
- Use tiered project structure (separate the application in layers)
- The service layer (i.e., "business" functionality) must have at least 80% unit test code coverage
- Follow [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) when writing unit tests
- You should implement proper exception handling and propagation
- Try to think ahead. When developing something, think – “How hard would it be to change/modify this later?”
## <a name="database"></a>Database
The data of the application must be stored in a relational database. You need to identify the core domain objects and model their relationships accordingly. Database structure should avoid data duplication and empty data (normalize your database).

Your repository must include two scripts – one to create the database and one to fill it with data.
## <a name="deliverables"></a>Git
Commits in the GitLab repository should give a good overview of how the project was developed, which features were created first and the people who contributed. Contributions from all team members must be evident through the git commit history! The repository must contain the complete application source code and any scripts (database scripts, for example).

Provide a link to a GitLab repository with the following information in the README.md file:

- Project description
- Link to the Swagger documentation (must)
- Link to the hosted project (if hosted online)
- Instructions how to setup and run the project locally 
- Images of the database relations (must)

## <a name="optional-requirements"></a>Optional Requirements
Besides all requirements marked as should and could, here are some more *optional* requirements:

- Integrate your project with a Continuous Integration server (e.g., GitLab’s own) and configure your unit tests to run on each commit to your master branch
- Host your application's backend in a public hosting provider of your choice (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku)
- Use branches while working with Git
# [](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
# Legend
- Must – Implement these first.
- Should – if you have time left, try to implement these.
- Could – only if you are ready with everything else give these a go.
